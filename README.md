## Introduction
[BipedalWalker-v3](https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalker-v2/) is an environment in OpenAI gym. Reward is given for moving forward, total 300+ points up to the far end. If the robot falls, it gets -100.

[Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) is a set of improved implementations of Reinforcement Learning algorithms based on OpenAI [Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines).
